## Inefficient Learning
My project where I have been practicing implementing machine learning 
algorithms from scratch, code will be in Python and I'll test 
out some stuff with Java or C++ too! I just find that I learn
machine learning techniques best when I try to implement them
from scratch.

Here are just a few of my plans of algorithms that I will be
implementing some time in the future:
* Naive Bayes (which I've already begun)
* An exploration of recommendation systems (Pearson 
correlation)
* Neural Networks.
